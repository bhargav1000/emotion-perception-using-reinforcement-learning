#Problem Definition:
	
An intelligence system is an autonomous system that is capable of performing actions without direct dependence on the user. 
An intelligence must be able to prompt or suggest to the user the list or possibilities of the actions that can be performed or 
are possible at the given moment with the decision to act left to the user. 
It must also be adaptive to a given situation and must be able to guide the user to a safer or convenient situation 
depending on the severity of the given situation.
