# Emotion Perception using Reinforcement Learning

This is a model with an interactive UI that allows users to choose between facial emotion  detection through Raspberry Pi Camera and text emotion detection through an  external Kernel using Python. It is also capable of understanding emotions and will be programmed to respond appropriately to the dialog, a stress detection feature will also be added to help in stressful situations. Deployed Keras with TensorFlow backend, OpenCV,  Raspbian OS, and Kaggle Kernel over LSTM, RNN, and Haar Cascade were to achieve  an accuracy of 96.5%. **The project won the Best Engineering Project Award for  2019 from Visvesvaraya Technological University.**
